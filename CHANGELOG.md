# Changelog

All notable changes to kero. This file is the **source of truth for the release
notes shown in the in-app updater**: [`scripts/release.ts`](scripts/release.ts)
extracts the section whose heading matches the version being released
(`MARKETING_VERSION`) and publishes it next to the update, so Sparkle shows it in
the update prompt.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Add a new
`## [<version>]` section at the top for each release, matching the version you
set in the Xcode project.
